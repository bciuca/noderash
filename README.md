Raspberry Pi GPIO Experiments in Node.js and RxJS

Program the GPIO in JavaScript and RxJS. Listen for changes on a pin or write to a pin asynchronously using [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).

## Useage
Run through some tests without a Raspberry Pi using the `gpio-stub.js` module to simulate reading and writing to a pin.
